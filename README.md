# Nagi

Nagi is a cross platform anime and manga tracker/viewer somewhat based on [Taiga](https://github.com/erengy/taiga) by [Eren Okka](https://github.com/erengy) and [Lollypop](https://github.com/gnumdk/lollypop) by [CÃ©dric Bellegarde](https://github.com/gnumdk).

If you think you know where (or how) I the got the name, message me and we will see if you're right.

### Fun Fact
This is the first project that I've made that first compiled on OSX with Travis CI, I mean I use Windows how come Appveyor didn't work first.
